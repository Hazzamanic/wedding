                        Faro Airport
                    </h2>
                    <p>The closest airport is FARO - approximately an hour from Lagos by road.</p>

                    <p>To get to Lagos there is a local train from the town centre of Faro at fairly sporadic times, but very reliable, cheap and spacious for luggage:
                    CP - Comboios de Portugal</p>

                    <p>By road, airport transfers to book in advance: Faro Airport Transfers to Lagos » Algarve Private Taxis »
                    Approximately an hour journey time, 75 euro per 4 person vehicle</p>

                    <p>Uber/Bolt is also readily available but cannot guarantee the price you will pay.</p>

                    <p>For those arriving into Faro on Friday and leaving on Tuesday, we will look to arrange a transfer for you all. Please let us know your confirmed flight times but we will be looking at around Friday 1pm from Faro airport, Tuesday 10am pick up from the villas.</p>

                    <p>Car rental: lots of options at the airport, again best to book in advance. We have done this once and had a good experience with Economy Bookings search engine / 'Best Deal' car rental. You have to go to the airport carpark and their shuttle will take you to their depot just down the road. When we were there, the queue for the car rental places on site of the airport was ENORMOUS so would recommend booking in advance, but obviously we can't vouch for this all the time.</p>

                        Lisbon Airport
                    </h2>
                    <p>For those extending their trip, the train journey between Lagos/Lisbon is great and takes about 3 hours. 
                    You will take the local train between Lagos --> Tunes, then Tunes --> Lisbon or the reverse. 
                    Again, book using the official Portugal train website for seat reservations on the Tunes/Lisbon leg and lowest prices.</p>
